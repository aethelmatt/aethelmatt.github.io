# Intro

* Matt(hew) Lucas (soon to be Lucas-Clarke once I start updating things)
* Member of an internal Red Team from April 2024, opinions etc my own
* ex-MWR/F-Secure/WithSecure 2020-2024, UK team lead for Attack Path Mapping for ~1 year
* Oxford Physics MPhys 2020, don't ask me to remember any physics
* Aethelmatt is because I find the old Anglo-Saxon Aethelred/Aethelstan/Aethelwald names aesthetically pleasing 

# Public work

* [Methods of Lateral Movement using Windows OpenSSH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuClX4Cjfao&t=2s&pp=ygUVbWF0dGhldyBsdWNhcyBvcGVuc3No), presented at SEC-T 2023 and BSides Cambridge 2023
* [Performing and Preventing Attacks on Azure Cloud Environments through Azure DevOps](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/performing-and-preventing-attacks-on-azure-cloud-environments-through-azure-devops) and the companion piece [Detecting Attacks against Azure DevOps](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/detecting-attacks-against-azure-devops)
* The Azure DevOps pieces were accurate at the time, but since cloud is so fast-moving I'd recommend cross-checking anything I've said there with more recent work/MS docs; I don't work there any more so I personally won't get to update that blog as MS moves on. Most recent piece I'm aware of is Brett Hawkins' [whitepaper](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/10a99803d42fd1e5). 

# Stay tuned for...

* Things! I'll hopefully be posting more research/doing more conference talks in future, watch this space.
